## HPC Access

You will need to have an HPC user account for the workshop.  You can either use your own account or we will provide
a temporary workshop account.


## Example Files

You will find the example [files used in this tutorial here.](https://github.com/khill42/OSC_IntroHPC/raw/gh-pages/files/hpcCarpentry.zip)




## Connecting to cluster

You can download an SSH client below if you wish, but we will do all of today's activities using our web portal, OnDemand 
[https://ondemand.osc.edu](https://ondemand.osc.edu).

**Windows**

Install [PuTTY Client](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), ensure you pick the appropriate 32 or 64 bit edition.

**macOS**

OSx comes pre-isntalled with an SSH Client, access it via your terminal.

**Linux**

Linux OS comes pre-isntalled with an SSH Client, access it via your terminal.

## STFP

GUI tools to make transferring files easier.

**All OS**

Filezilla is still a useful tool, but today's file transfers will not require it.

[FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) is a Graphical Program used to transfer files between your computer and a remote HPC setup.
Filezilla can be used on Windows, OSx, and Linux.
