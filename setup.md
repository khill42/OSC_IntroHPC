[https://ondemand.osc.edu](https://ondemand.osc.edu).

**Windows**

Install [PuTTY Client](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), ensure you pick the appropriate 32 or 64 bit edition.

**macOS**

OSx comes pre-isntalled with an SSH Client, access it via your terminal.

GUI tools to make transferring files easier.

**All OS**

Filezilla is still a useful tool, but today's file transfers will not require it.

[FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) is a Graphical Program used to transfer files between your computer and a remote HPC setup.
Filezilla can be used on Windows, OSx, and Linux.
